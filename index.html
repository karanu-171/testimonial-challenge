            <p>"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp I have been looking to make a transition and I have heard some people who heard an amazing experience here. I signed up for the tree intro course and found it incredibly fun. I enrolled
                shortl thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best and most grueling-time of my life. Since completing the course. I've successfully switched careers working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup"</p>

            <p class="c">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
            <p class="color">"Before joining the bootcamp.I've never written a line of code.I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things
                about the program.The entire cirriculum and staff did not dissapoint.They were very hands-on before and I never had to wait long for assistance.The agile team project in particular, was outstanding it took my learning to the next level
                in a way that no tutorial could ever have.In fact.I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience.It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.100% recommended!

            <p>"The staff seem genuinely concernced about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the
